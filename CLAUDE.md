# Smart 1 Hub

Internal tool suite for Smart 1 Marketing. Flask, deployed on Render via
Docker, ~22 modules mounted under one login.

**Live:** https://smart1-hub.onrender.com · **Repo:** `Smart-1-Marketing/smarthub`

---

## Architecture in one page

`wsgi.py` is the entry point. It builds the hub app and mounts every module
through `DispatcherMiddleware`, wrapped in `AuthGuard` (login) and `HubBar`
(injects the sidebar, help layer and breadcrumbs into every response).

Modules attach one of two ways, and the difference matters:

1. **Dispatcher-mounted** — a standalone Flask app under a URL prefix
   (`/scans`, `/tools/seo-images`). Has its own Jinja environment.
2. **Blueprint-registered** — registered on the hub app itself
   (`modules/tickets`, `calculators`, `image_picker`, `page_image_optimizer`,
   `google_access`).

Shared services live in `hub/`: `config.py` (typed settings), `storage.py`
(Cloudinary), `ai.py` (OpenAI + cost tracking), `images.py`, `audit.py`
(activity log), `extensions.py` (the shared SQLAlchemy instance),
`scheduler.py` (background jobs).

## Traps — every one of these has cost a working feature

**A hub route under a mounted prefix is unreachable.** DispatcherMiddleware
routes purely by URL prefix, so `@app.route("/sites/match")` on the hub app
never gets called — `/sites` belongs to Sites Admin. This has bitten three
times. `/api/integrity` has a high-severity check for it.

**Module Jinja environments are separate.** Globals registered on the hub app
are invisible inside a mounted module. `{{ help_dot(...) }}` in a module
template raises `UndefinedError` and 500s the page unless
`install_template_helpers()` ran for that app. Every helper call is written
`{{ help_dot('x') if help_dot is defined else '' }}` so a missing registration
degrades to a missing icon rather than a dead page. Keep that pattern.

**Two gunicorn workers.** Anything with a timer or a background thread runs
twice unless it takes the leader lock in `hub/scheduler.py`. Same reason
`create_all()` is wrapped in a Postgres advisory lock — concurrent `CREATE
TABLE` produces a `pg_type_typname_nsp_index` unique violation on every deploy.

**Bubbles mount on late-rendered content.** Client 360, the SEO client page
and Image Creator draw panels from a fetch. `hub-help.js` runs a debounced
MutationObserver for this. A bubble added to a JS-rendered panel works; one
added before that observer existed did not.

**`audit.log()`'s first positional is `module`.** Passing `module=` in the
extras raises `TypeError` and silently zeroes cost tracking. Use `tool=`.

**Env var names drifted.** This deployment sets `PEXELS_API` and
`PIXABAY_API`; much of the code was written against `..._API_KEY`. Config
accepts both. If a provider reports "no API key set" while the key is clearly
present, that's the cause.

**Placeholder values are worse than blanks.** `CLOUDINARY_URL` sat at
`cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME` and every "is it configured?"
check said yes. `hub/config.py` detects the known placeholders. Render also
stores quotes literally — `SCANS_CALLBACK_TOKEN="abc"` includes the quotes,
which silently breaks callback matching.

**Absent data must read as "not measured", not zero.** A clean-looking zero
is a wrong answer presented confidently.

## Data sources, and which are stale

| Source | How it's read | Freshness |
|---|---|---|
| Knack products / campaigns / websites | static JSON in `clients_app/data/` | **stale — nothing refreshes these** |
| Knack object_153 (website registry) | live API, `hub/knack_websites.py` | current |
| Knack tickets | live API, `hub/knack_api.py` | current |
| Insites scans | own SQLite/Postgres tables | current |
| GoHighLevel | live API | current |

**The static JSON exports are the biggest known problem.** Insertion-order
data on Client 360 is only as fresh as the last manual export. Moving products
and campaigns onto the live API is the highest-value outstanding work; it needs
their Knack object IDs.

**The URL is the join key, not the name.** Eleven field names hold a URL
across this codebase (`url`, `domain`, `website`, `web_url`, `site_url`…).
`hub/client_context.canonical_domain()` is the single place that decides what
a domain means. Name matching produces false positives — "Riverside HVAC" vs
"Riverside HVAC LLC" — and is why billing audits report phantom problems.

## Conventions

- **No new Python dependencies** unless genuinely unavoidable.
- Module layout: `modules/<name>/app.py` (Flask app or blueprint),
  `templates/`, mounted in `wsgi.py` with a try/except and `_fallback_app()`.
- New tools get a tile in `hub/templates/tools.html` under the right group.
  A tool with no tile is invisible — six were, for weeks.
- Anything producing client work should call `audit.log(...)` with
  `client=` so it appears on that client's 360 record.
- Summary first, detail behind a click. Label absent data explicitly.
- Guard boot-time failures, but **record them** — a swallowed exception is how
  `/signup` 404'd for a day with no clue why.

## Verifying a change

Booting the app catches what static analysis misses; several serious bugs were
only found by running it.

```bash
python3 -c "import ast,pathlib; [ast.parse(p.read_text(errors='ignore')) \
  for p in pathlib.Path('.').rglob('*.py') if '_attic' not in p.parts]"
node --check hub/static/*.js
```

Then boot through `wsgi.application` (not just the hub app — that's how mount
shadowing hides) and request the pages you touched. `/api/integrity` reports
known defect patterns; `/login/health` diagnoses sign-in without a session.

## Delivery

`git push` from the sandbox has always been blocked, so releases have gone out
as zips uploaded through GitHub's browser UI. **That uploader adds and
overwrites but never deletes**, which is why the repo root accumulated 65
stray files. If you can push directly, do — it removes the whole class of
problem.
